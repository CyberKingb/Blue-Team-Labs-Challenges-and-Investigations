## Challenge Senario
Youâ€™re a senior cyber security engineer and during your shift, we have intercepted/noticed a high privilege actions from unknown source that could be identified as malicious. We have got you the ticket that made these actions.
You are the one who created the secret for these tickets. Please fix this and submit the low privilege ticket so we can make sure that you deserve this position.

### ***Here is the ticket:***

## Challenge Submission
### **1) Can you identify the name of the token? (Format: String) (2 points)**

From the ticket we can see that the text is in base 64 format.
So heading on to `cyberchef` I used the from Base 64 recepie and got the true output of the ticket, from the output i saw `JWT` which is short for JSON Web Token.

So the token name should be `JWT`

### **#2) What is the structure of this token? (Format: Section.Section.Section) (2 points)**

The structure of a JSON Web Token is `header-token-signature`

### **#3) What is the hint you found from this token? (Format: String) (2 points)**

From the cyberchef output in the second line there is `"flag":"BTL{_4_Eyes}"` which should be a hint since the question asked for a string our answer should be `_4_Eye`

### **#4) What is the Secret? (Format: String) (2 points)**

To find the secret we need to crack the jwt token by bruteforcing it with hashcat.

For this we firstly copy the token and put it into a `.txt` file. I put mine into `secret.txt`.

![Saving the Token into a file](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/935b10b3-9b6e-4924-bc37-dad965ce2bad)

Now on our command line we input `hashcat secret.txt -m 16500 -a 3 ?a?a?a?a`

- hashcat: The command-line utility for running the Hashcat program.
  
- secret.txt: This is the input file containing the hashes we want to crack. Hashcat will read this file to get the hashes that need to be cracked.

- -m 16500: This specifies the hash mode. In this case, 16500 is the mode for "JSON Web Token". 
  
- -a 3: This specifies the attack mode. 3 stands for "Brute-Force" attack mode. In this mode, Hashcat will try every possible combination of characters to crack the hash.
  
- ?a?a?a?a: This is the mask for the brute-force attack. ?a represents all possible characters (including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters). The mask ?a?a?a?a means Hashcat will try every combination of four characters from the set of all possible characters.
I found the secret to be `bT!0`

### **#5) Can you generate a new verified signature ticket with a low privilege? (Format: String.String.String) (2 points)**

For this I needed to paste the token given in the challenge into (https://jwt.io/) debugger so I could also input the secret I found in question 2. I also had to change the `admin=true` to `admin=false`.

And the result I got is `eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJmbGFnIjoiQlRMe180X0V5ZXN9IiwiaWF0Ijo5MDAwMDAwMCwibmFtZSI6IkdyZWF0RXhwIiwiYWRtaW4iOmZhbHNlfQ.nMXNFvttCvtDcpswOQA8u_LpURwv6ZrCJ-ftIXegtX4`
